The code can be used to find the solutions to the 'Lazor' game.

It reads in .bff file, uses class object and finally generates a text which shows how to solve the game.
This code allows for three types of blocks- A: reflect blocks, B: opaque blocks, C: refract blocks and also fixed blocks of these three types are also accounted for. All the .bff files of the game are uploaded to this repository.
In order to solve the game, you need:

Download the LazorProject.py and the .bff files.
Open the LazorProject.py file and change the filename at the end of the file.
Run the code and see the generated text or file.
